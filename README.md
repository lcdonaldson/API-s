# API's
<p>API's are about integrating useful pieces of other people's programs to enhance your own project. Like getting the weather forcast for your area even if you're not making a weather app.<p>
<p>This repo will mostly feature REST endpoints as it is still the most popular type of API call, but some SOAP calls and even some GraphQL queries will be included.</p>
